    <b>Vellore Fort, located in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, is a remarkable historical monument built around 1566 CE by Chinna Bommi Nayaka and Thimma Reddy Nayaka under the Vijayanagara Empire. Known for its impressive granite construction, the fort is famous for its massive walls, wide moat (once filled with crocodiles), and strong defensive architecture. Over the centuries, it changed hands from the Vijayanagara rulers to the Bijapur Sultans, Marathas, Mughals, and finally the British. It holds immense historical significance, especially as the site of the Vellore Mutiny of 1806, one of the earliest uprisings against British rule in India. A unique aspect of the fort is its religious diversity—it houses the Jalakanteswarar Temple (a fine example of Dravidian architecture), a mosque built by the Arcot Nawabs, and St. John’s Church built during British rule. Today, Vellore Fort stands as a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage, drawing tourists for its historical importance, architectural brilliance, and the peaceful coexistence of different religious structures within its walls.</b>

<p>     <b>Vellore Airport is a small domestic airport located near Abdullapuram, about 5 kilometers from Vellore city in Tamil Nadu. Originally built in the 1930s by the British, the airport has been under development in recent years as part of the Indian government’s UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) regional connectivity scheme. Once operational, Vellore Airport is expected to improve air travel accessibility for residents of Vellore and nearby districts, reducing the dependency on larger airports in Chennai or Bengaluru. The airport is primarily intended to handle small aircraft for short-haul regional flights. With the growing demand for faster travel and economic development in the region, the airport holds potential to boost tourism, healthcare travel (especially to Vellore's famous CMC Hospital), and business connectivity.</b>
